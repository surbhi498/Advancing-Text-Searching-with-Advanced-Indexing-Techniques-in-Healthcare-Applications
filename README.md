# Advancing Text Searching with Advanced Indexing Techniques in Healthcare Applications(In Progress)

Welcome to the project repository for advancing text searching with advanced indexing techniques in healthcare applications. This project implements a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically designed to enhance text searching capabilities within the healthcare domain.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **BioLLM 8B**: Advanced language model for generating and processing medical text.
- **ClinicalBert**: State-of-the-art embedding model for accurate representation of medical texts.
- **Qdrant**: Self-hosted Vector Database (Vector DB) for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
- **Langchain & Llama CPP**: Orchestration frameworks for seamless integration and workflow management.
