# Advancing Text Searching with Advanced Indexing Techniques in Healthcare Applications(In Progress)

Welcome to the project repository for advancing text searching with advanced indexing techniques in healthcare applications. This project implements a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically designed to enhance text searching capabilities within the healthcare domain.I have also implemented Multimodal Text Searching for Medical Documents.

## üöÄ Features For Text Based Medical Query Based System

- **BioLLM 8B**: Advanced language model for generating and processing medical text.
- **ClinicalBert**: State-of-the-art embedding model for accurate representation of medical texts.
- **Qdrant**: Self-hosted Vector Database (Vector DB) for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
- **Langchain & Llama CPP**: Orchestration frameworks for seamless integration and workflow management.

# Medical Knowledge Base Query System

A multimodal medical information retrieval system combining text and image-based querying for comprehensive medical knowledge access.

### üß† Multimodal Medical Information Retrieval
- Combines text and image-based querying for comprehensive medical knowledge access
- Uses Qdrant vector database to store and retrieve both text and image embeddings

### üî§ Advanced Natural Language Processing
- Utilizes ClinicalBERT for domain-specific text embeddings
- Implements NVIDIA's Palmyra-med-70b model for medical language understanding

### üñºÔ∏è Image Analysis Capabilities
- Incorporates CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) for image feature extraction
- Generates image summaries using Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model

### üìÑ PDF Processing
- Extracts text and images from medical PDF documents
- Implements intelligent chunking strategies for text processing

### üîç Vector Search
- Uses Qdrant for efficient similarity search on both text and image vectors
- Implements hybrid search combining CLIP-based image similarity and text-based summary similarity

### üñ•Ô∏è Interactive User Interface
- Gradio-based web interface for easy querying and result visualization
- Displays relevant text responses alongside related medical images

### üß© Extensible Architecture
- Modular design allowing for easy integration of new models or data sources
- Supports both local and cloud-based model deployment 
The high level architectural framework for this application is given as follows:
